title: Hi, I'm Shivram

Welcome to my website! I'm an amateur programmer who makes tiny projects. I mostly work with JavaScript and Python.

Right now, I'm working on a variety of side projects, such as a math expression parser, and a compiled programming language.

I love open-source software, and simple, accessible websites. I also like to rant about things on my [blog]({{site.url}}/blog).
