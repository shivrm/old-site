title: Hi, I'm Shivram

Welcome to my website! I'm an amateur programmer who makes tiny projects. I mostly work with JavaScript and Python. Right now, I'm working on a variety of side projects, such as a [math expression parser](https://github.com/shivrm/mathrs), and a compiled programming language.

I love open-source software, and simple, accessible websites. I also have a [blog]({{site.url}}/blog), where I write about things that interest me.

# Projects


A small gallery of projects by me. Want to see more? Visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/shivrm).

* ## [twine]({{site.url}}/twine)
    **twine** is a data-serialization format that stores your data in a binary form. Data stored in this format takes up half as much space as JSON. As a bonus, it's also streamable.
    
* ## [chip8](https://github.com/shivrm/chip8)
    **chip8** is a virtual machine that interprets the CHIP-8 programming language. It's written in Python and creates it's own window.
    
    P.S. Too slow for you? Try [ch8](https://gist.github.com/shivrm/904096ab5fbcc5e0a4c23177d04c65f1), a C rewrite of the VM.
        
* ## [notes]({{site.url}}/notes)
    **notes** is a web app that lets you create sticky notes in a variety of colors and fonts. It's a Svelte SPA that stores all the data in the browser itself. It's also one of the first projects I ever made.
    
* ## [mathrs](https://github.com/shivrm/mathrs)
    **mathrs** is a simple math expression parser written in Rust. It uses a recursive descent parser, supports all basic operators, and even has proper operator precedence.

# Technologies

*   Python and JavaScript
